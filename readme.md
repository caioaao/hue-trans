# hue-trans

Transpiler for react-native apps. Optimizes everything using state of the art techniques for games.

## Warning

This transpiler is optimized for brazilian games. Some hueristics used here were product of thorough market research on several brazilian apps and usage. Benchmarks are not available now, but it's top-priority on our roadmap.

## Benchmarks

We've noticed massive improvements on all games we optimized. Worst case scenario (for very complex game levels) we noticed an improvement of 1x. This is a good lower bound, as it never presents any loss on game quality, no matter what.
